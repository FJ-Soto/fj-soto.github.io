                    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio ðŸ‘‹</h2>
                    <p>Â¡Buenas! Mi nombre es Fernando Soto.</p>
                    <p>I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a background in Computer Science and
                        Mathematics, holding a Bachelor of Science in both fields from Dominican University. Rooted in
                        my Mexican heritage, I bring creativity, determination, and a unique perspective to
                        problem-solving and engineering challenges.</p>
                    <p>I specialize in building efficient and scalable solutions, with expertise in C#, React,
                        SQL, Python, and more. My projects range from developing web applications to creating automation
                        tools, always with a focus on delivering impactful results.</p>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I thrive on endurance challengesâ€”my endurance background truly sets me apart from
                        other engineers. If you're looking for someone who can persevere and get the job done, I'm your
                        person! Before 2024, I had no athletic background, but that year was nothing short of explosive.
                        What began as a simple goal to complete a cycling century quickly evolved into pushing my limits
                        further than I ever imagined within a single year.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are a few of my proudest accomplishments! You can learn more about them in my blog section
                        (coming soon)!</p>

                        <dd>A challenge around climbing the equivalent of Mount Everest (8848 meters) on local hills
                            with no
                            sleep in between.
                            I accomplished this in Chicago which is known for one of the flattest cities!</dd>

                        <dd>Like an Everest, except the elevation is 10,000 meters AND it has to cover at least 400 km
                            of distance
                            within 36 hours. I also completed this in Chicago!</dd>

                        <dd>Throughout the year, I increased my cycling distances from 100mi, 150mi, 200mi, and 250mi. I
                            wanted
                            to see what the agreed, self-supported upper-limit for distance was and it was about 400
                            miles. I drafted a route based on routes I have ridden in the past and went accross
                            Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.</dd>

                        <dt><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12309622227" target="_blank">Marathon</a></dt>
                        <dd>Strava has milestones for cycling, and I speedran through those. There were two milestones
                            that I had yet to complete: a marathon and an ultra-marathon. I am not much of a runner, but
                            I wanted to prove to myself that I could!</dd>

                        <dt><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12785966983" target="_blank">Ultra-Marathon (run
                                art)</a></dt>
                        <dd>My friend, who's deeply into Spartan Races, inspired me to dive into running for 2025. To
                            celebrate his birthday just before one of his toughest Spartan Races, I crafted a run art
                            route to wish him well!

                    <p class="no-top">In engineering terms, my growth for the year of 2024 was O(2<sup>n</sup>)! I look
                        forward to continue growing
                        as an engineer and pursuing even more crazy endurance challenges.</p>

                                            This was accomplished through code profiling, schema analysis, and strategic

                                    This project was inspired by the challenges of building a personal gaming computer
                                    during the GPU shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the bitcoin mining boom.
                                    At the time, GPUs were difficult to find in stock due to high demand and automated
                                    bots, and retailers like BestBuy implemented anti-bot mechanisms, making it a race
                                    for availability. To address this, I developed a cross-platform desktop application
                                    using Python and
                                    Tkinter to streamline GPU stock tracking and automate portions of the checkout
                                    process.
                                    The app provided a graphical interface for checking real-time stock availability
                                    from BestBuy, leveraging Python's web scraping libraries to navigate dynamic content
                                    and stock updates.
